    "query_generation_prompt": "Based on the following risk configuration, identify exactly what kind of recent information should be searched online to assess risk severity for each of the specified domains. Focus primarily on risks affecting EU and Croatia, and only secondarily on global risks, but do not omit any domains. Prioritize only the most recent, high-impact developments, but do not omit any domains. The goal is to determine what queries should be made to obtain relevant, non-redundant information for evaluating whether any red lines are being approached for each of the specified domains. \n\nReturn your result strictly as a JSON array of objects. First, extract all the risk domains defined in the configuration and the list of keywords for each domain which is defined in the keywords array - you must include these exact phrases into the search queries list. Then, for each domain, generate multiple additional search queries based on the complexity and the number of items listed under that domain — but make sure you generate at least 1 distinct query for each indicator and each trigger of each domain - these are defined in the triggers and indicators arrays of each risk domain, so if there are 5 elements of the triggers array and 5 elements of the indicators array, there should be 10 additional queries for this domain in total. Make sure that queries are neither too general nor too specific to return the most relevant results. All domains received in the risk configuration must be covered by your generated queries list in the exact order as the domains are specified - do not omit or change the order!\n\nDo NOT combine queries using logical OR. Each query must be a separate object in the array so that they can be searched individually. Keep each query concise, under 100 characters, and avoid redundancy between queries. Each query object in the JSON array must include the domain name, the query string, the language, and an AI-determined time range (`from` and `to`) in ISO date format reflecting the past 30 days, which will be used internally for historical tracking rather than filtering the search.\n\nThe query strings must not contain specific month names or years, since those are already implied by the date range.\n\nFormat:\n[\n  {\n    \"domain\": \"<risk domain>\",\n    \"query\": \"<search term or phrase>\",\n  \"from\": \"<ISO date>\",\n  \"to\": \"<ISO date>\" \n  },\n  ...\n]\n\nOnly return the JSON array without any leading or trailing characters or comments - the JSON must be able to go through a JSON parser without any issues - make sure to sanitize it and clear it before returning it to verify that any excess leading or trailing characters are removed. The order of domains must remain the same as in the risk configuration that you received. Do not include any explanations or headers. The current date is ((currentDate)). See the attached risk configuration.",
    "data_analysis_prompt": "Analyze the following news data that contains search results grouped by risk domain and specific query. For each domain, assess the most recent and significant developments based on the news data provided. Focus primarily on Croatia and the EU, and secondarily on global trends only where relevant. Your goal is to evaluate the current severity of each risk area and identify any red lines that may raise alarms or require urgent resolution.\n\nProvide a structured domain-by-domain analysis. Do not include background explanations or general commentary — assume I am already familiar with the broader risk landscape. Highlight only urgent or significant changes based on the data, and avoid false alarms or overgeneralizations. Include each domain from the risk configuration in your report, even if there are no news associated with this domain, but only make conclusion based on the news, not based on the risk configuration itself - if there are no news associated with this domain, just mention the domain and state that there are no recent news or developments.\n\nMake your report concise but detailed enough to support decision-making. If there are any relevant news, add the URL of each news article in the plain text format to your report so I can easily copy it and see the details - it should not be a clickable link, but a plain text which I will be able to copy easily. I am attaching 2 files: risk configuration file and the news file."
